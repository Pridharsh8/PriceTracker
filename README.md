Price Tracker using UiPath RPA

This project is an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solution developed using UiPath to automatically track the price of products from websites. The bot monitors product prices, compares them to a threshold, and sends an email alert when the price drops below the desired value.

Features:

Automated price extraction from e-commerce or product listing websites.
Price comparison with a pre-defined target price.
Email notifications when the price drops below the target.
